René Magritte
November 21, 1898, Lessines, Belgium - August 15, 1967, Brussels, Belgium
René François Ghislain Magritte was a Belgian surrealist painter. Known for his witty and provocative images, he sought with his work to change the preconditioned perception of reality and force the observer to become hypersensitive to his surroundings.
Magritte endowed Surrealism with a conceptual charge based on the play of ambiguous images and their meaning denoted through words, calling into question the relationship between a painted and a real object. (Wikipedia, Google Translate)
