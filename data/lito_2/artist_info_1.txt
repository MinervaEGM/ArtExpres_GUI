Gustav Klimt
Baumgarten, July 14, 1862-Alsergrund, February 6, 1918
Gustav Klimt was an Austrian symbolist painter, and one of the most conspicuous representatives of the modernist movement of the Viennese secession. Klimt painted canvases and murals in a highly ornate personal style, which he also manifested through handicrafts, such as those found in the Gallery of Viennese Secession. Intellectually related to a certain romantic ideology, Klimt found in the female nude one of his most recurrent sources of inspiration. His works are endowed with an intense sensual energy, reflected with particular clarity in his numerous notes and pencil sketches, somehow heirs to the tradition of erotic drawings by Rodin and Ingres.
