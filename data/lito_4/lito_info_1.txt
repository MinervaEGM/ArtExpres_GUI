The Kiss
Gustav Klimt
180cm x 180cm
The Kiss is the work of Austrian painter Gustav Klimt and probably his best-known work. It is an oil with gold and tin lamellae on canvas of 180 x 180 centimeters, made between 1907-08.
This work, which follows the canons of Symbolism, is a fabric with decorations and mosaics on a golden background. It is exhibited at the Ã–sterreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna. Klimt's works usually created scandals and were criticized as "pornography" and for being "excessively perverted." The works put Klimt as an "enfant terrible" for his anti-authoritarian and anti-populist views on art. He wrote: "If you cannot please everyone with your works and your art, please please a few." By contrast, The Kiss was enthusiastically received, and it immediately found a buyer.
