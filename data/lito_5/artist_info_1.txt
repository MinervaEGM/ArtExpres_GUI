Vincent van Gogh
Zundert, March 30, 1853-Auvers-sur-Oise, July 29, 1890
Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch painter, one of the main exponents of post-impressionism. He painted some 900 pictures (including 43 self-portraits and 148 watercolors) and made over 1,600 drawings. The quality of his work was recognized only after his death, in a retrospective exhibition in 1890, currently considering himself one of the great masters of the history of painting. It greatly influenced 20th century art, especially among German Expressionists and Fauvists like Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck, and Kees Van Dongen.
