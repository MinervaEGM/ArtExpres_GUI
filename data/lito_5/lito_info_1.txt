Starry Night Over the Rhône
Vincent van Gogh
72.5 cm × 92 cm
Starry night over the Rhone is one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings of the city of Arles at night. It was painted in a place on the banks of the Rhone that was just a two-minute walk from the Yellow House in Lamartine Square, which Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and night light effects provided the theme for some of his most famous paintings, including Cafe Terrace at Night (painted earlier in the same month) and the back canvas in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, The starry Night.
