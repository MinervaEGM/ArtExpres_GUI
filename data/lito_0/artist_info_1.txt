Salvador Dalí i Domènech
Figueres, May 11, 1904 - January 23, 1989
Salvador Dalí is known for his striking and dreamlike surreal images. His pictorial skills are usually attributed to the influence and admiration for Renaissance art. He was also an expert cartoonist. Dalí's plastic resources also addressed cinema, sculpture and photography, which led to numerous collaborations with other audiovisual artists. He had the ability to recognize a genuinely personal and palpable style at first contact, which was actually very eclectic and "sucked in" on outside innovations. One of his most famous paintings is The Persistence of Memory (also known as The Soft Clocks), made in 1931. (Wikipedia, Google Translate)
