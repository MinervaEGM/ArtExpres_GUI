116cm × 89cm
The Son of Man (French: Le Fils de l'Homme) is a painting from 1964 by the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte, and his best-known work.
Magritte painted it as a self-portrait. The painting consists of a man in a coat, red tie and bowler hat standing in front of a wall. Beyond is the sea and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a floating green apple. However, the man's eyes can be seen peeking out from the edge of the apple.
