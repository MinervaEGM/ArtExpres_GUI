Not to Be Reproduced (La reproduction interdite, 1937) is a painting by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte. It is currently owned by the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam.
This painting was commissioned by poet and Magritte patron Edward James and is considered a portrait of James although James's face is not depicted. This painting was one of three produced by Magritte for the ballroom of James's London home. The other two were The Red Model (1937) and Time Transfixed (1938).
The work depicts a man standing in front of a mirror, but whereas the book on the mantelpiece is reflected correctly, the man's reflection also shows him from behind. (Wikipedia)
